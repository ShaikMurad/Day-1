Question 1:

Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Introduction : 

HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. By using HTTP the user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user.

Difference:


1.	HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.

2.	HTTP/1.1 works on the textual format & HTTP/2 works on the binary protocol.
3.	HTTP/ 1.1 It compresses data by itself & HTTP/ 2 it uses HPACK for data compression.

4.	HTTP/1.1  uses requests resource In lining for use getting multiple pages & HTTP/2 uses to push frame by server that collects all multiple pages.


5.	HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1.

6.	HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.

7.	Binary protocols consume less bandwidth, are more efficiently parsed and are less error-prone than the textual protocols used by HTTP/1.1

8.	 HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

Question 2:

objects and its internal representation in javascript:

An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects)
an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.
